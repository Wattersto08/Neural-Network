My Attempt at a supervised neural network, it can be reformatted easily for a variety of applications and i plan to make a an unsupervised varient for estimating price change in crypto-currency, i plan to upload that code when more progress has been made

Ideas and inspiration were drawn from the following litterature:
  "Hands On with Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow" - Aurélien Géron
  "Build your own neural Network" - Tariq Rashid
  
  
Developed using Jupyter notebooks, Matplotlib, Scikit and Numpy.
  
the Training Data in this instance is 60,000 points of data 
the Test uses only 10,000 

Currently I have refined it to 96% accuracy
